Blake is originally from Philadelphia but received a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from the University of Pittsburgh. He is currently pursuing a PhD from the Department of Pathology here at CWRU in the immunology training program. His general research interest is how microbial commensals interact with the host immune system and how that can impact disease.
