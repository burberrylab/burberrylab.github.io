We have identified candidate probiotic strains isolated from healthy human gut that reproducibly suppress inflammation. Ongoing studies aim to determine the optimal conditions for probiotic engraftment and test the efficacy of individual and combinations of probiotics to suppress neural inflammation in ALS mutant mice including those reconstituted with gut microbial communities from ALS patients with rapid disease course.
