Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is a devastating neurodegenerative disease that involves loss of motor neurons important for voluntary movement. Genetic factors enhance risk to develop ALS or the related disorder Frontotemporal dementia (FTD), but many people with a genetic risk factor never develop the disease. This suggests that environmental exposures are important modifiers of if and when someone will develop ALS/FTD. We found that mice that model a common ALS/FTD mutation develop inflammation in their brain and spinal cord that was highly dependent on signals derived from gut microbes. Ongoing work in the lab aims to identify the microbes and microbial byproducts in the gut that contribute to neural inflammation in FTD/ALS patients, to identify the key physiologic pathways that promote neurodegeneration and to evaluate patientsâ€™ gut microbiome as a biomarker.
